# realtime_mandelbrot
Wow, this is what we all have been waiting for:
## A **Realtime Mandelbrot** renderer in C++ using SFML
* You can zoom and pan using your mouse and mouse wheel.

## I made a video about this project.
Feel free to watch and support.
* **Link**: tbc

## Compiling
* For Ubuntu (and probably every other Linux distro)
<code>
  g++ -c main.cpp && g++ main.o -o sfml-app -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
</code>

## Explanation
* Exact same principle as in my other repo: https://github.com/protob0y/mandelbrot_pygame/tree/main
* **but** optimized for speed (programming language, libs, data types, self-made algorithms,...)
